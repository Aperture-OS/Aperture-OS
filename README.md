### Aperture OS

Aperture OS is my first distro, created with the goal of becoming production-ready in the future. It is built entirely from scratch using the Linux From Scratch book as inspiration.

The distribution focuses on user-friendliness and simplicity, while still offering flexibility and full user-choice. It uses *Blink* as the package manager, with my own package repository composed of recipes which tell Blink how to instaall a package.

Aperture OS also features its own graphical installer, **Pulse**, built with *GTK and GOlang*. Pulse gives users full control over their setup, from choosing the System Kernel and Bootloader to selecting a desktop environment or window manager, all through a guided, user-friendly interface. Tutorials and info boxes provide helpful tips, including the pros and cons of different choices, making the installation process fun and simple for everyone.

*This is a test.*
