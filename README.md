### Aperture OS

Aperture OS is my first Linux distribution, created as a hobby project with the goal of becoming production-ready in the future. It is built entirely from scratch using the Linux From Scratch book.

The distribution focuses on user-friendliness and simplicity, while still offering flexibility and full user-choice. It uses *Blink as the package managers, with my own package repository composed on Tar Archives with prebuilt packages which, upon installation, will get untarred and the files inside it will get moved in the right directories.

Aperture OS also features its own graphical installer, **Pulse**, built on *Calamares*. Pulse gives users full control over their setup, from choosing the System Init Protocol to selecting a desktop environment or window manager, all through a guided, user-friendly interface. Tutorials and info boxes provide helpful tips, including the pros and cons of different choices, making the installation process fun and simple for everyone.
