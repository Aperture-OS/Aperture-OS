### Aperture OS

**Aperture OS** is my first Linux distribution, created as a hobby project with the goal of becoming production-ready in the future. It is built entirely from scratch using the Linux From Scratch book.

The distribution focuses on user-friendliness and simplicity, while still offering flexibility and full user-choice. It uses *pacman* and *yay* as the package managers, both accessible via a built-in helper called **Blink**. Blink searches both official repositories (*core, extra, community and multilib*) and the AUR to recommend the best package for your needs.

Aperture OS also features its own graphical installer, **Pulse**, built on *Calamares*. Pulse gives users full control over their setup, from choosing the System Init Protocol to selecting a desktop environment or window manager, all through a guided, user-friendly interface. Tutorials and info boxes provide helpful tips, including the pros and cons of different choices, making the installation process fun and simple for everyone.
